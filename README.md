# Trip-Statistics Engine using Hadoop Streaming





## This project processes trip data using Hadoop Streaming to compute per-taxi statistics and sorted output. It demonstrates how Hadoop Streaming can be used to process big data stored in HDFS









# Project Overview



## The goal of this was to analyze Trips and Taxis data using python scripts, automate the tasks by executable bash scripts and answer the questions related to a business problem

* ## What are the maximum, minimum, and average fares per taxi type?
* ## Which are the most active taxis based on trip count?







# ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

## \- Python

## \- Hadoop Streaming

## \- Bash scripting







# ðŸ“Š Results

## \- Aggregated total trips, max/min fare, and average fare per taxi

## \- Sorted output by trip count or fare efficiency







# Sample Output
